# Tools

Using Terraform for Infrastructure as a code and Amazon Web Service as a cloud platform

## Installation

1.Install Terraform (0.13 or higher version) on your deployment machine and give proper permission to AWS IAM on deployment machine

2. Change local.tf file value to create a real environment

3. I assume VPC is created so no new vpc create on this terraform file you have to input the value of vpc and subnet ids on local file
